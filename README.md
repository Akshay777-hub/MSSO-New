## 📖 Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Create an Account**
   - Register with your email and choose your role
   - Roles: Director, Production Manager, or Scheduling Coordinator

2. **Create a Project**
   - Set up a new film production project
   - Add project details and description

3. **Upload Screenplay**
   - Upload your screenplay in PDF format
   - The system will automatically extract scenes, characters, and locations

4. **Manage Resources**
   - Add actors and set their availability
   - Define locations and their availability windows
   - Set up any special constraints

5. **Generate Schedule**
   - Choose your preferred optimization algorithm
   - Set date ranges and parameters
   - Run the optimization engine

6. **Review and Adjust**
   - View the generated schedule
   - Make manual adjustments if needed
   - Export to various formats

### Optimization Algorithms

#### Ant Colony Optimization (ACOBM)
- **Best for**: Complex constraints and location-based scheduling
- **Approach**: Simulates ant colonies finding optimal paths
- **Strengths**: Excellent for minimizing travel between locations

#### Tabu Search (TSBM)
- **Best for**: Avoiding local optima in complex problems
- **Approach**: Uses memory to avoid revisiting recent solutions
- **Strengths**: Good for schedules with many actor/location conflicts

#### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSOBM)
- **Best for**: Balancing multiple optimization goals
- **Approach**: Inspired by bird flocking behavior
- **Strengths**: Balanced approach for various scheduling scenarios
